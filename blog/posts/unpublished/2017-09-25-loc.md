# language of cells `loc`
Tool is creating units, units are creating structure which could be simple or complex.

- units can reproduce 
- cell exist if only it is observed by another cell (scope)
- alone cell is imposible
  - ?or _unreachable_ unless it becoms observable

- ? purpose of communicating
  - > cells are grow and mutating ?due


```
put a
put b into env
```

Single unit properties:

- output of every cell is all observable cells

```
> loc helloenv
> 'helloenv' output: 
   env [a: b, b: a]
```

## consequences
- cells with identical properies are pairs, so `[a: b, b: a]` notation could be ommited 
or have another synax, for example `[a::b]`, meaning `a` and `b` observed by each other.

- cells are able to constuct tribes, where every member is connected to each other.
   - ? if cell ?kill member of tribe, it ?may become pursued by the tribe( like spider web, graph)
   - member in tribe has level of connection
   - member with strong connection become mutated cell
