title: Writing a tiny compiler
---

**keys:** _tutorial, break things by teaching it, desperate attempt_

<img src="../images/2.png" width="500px">

## Abstract
- **What:** writing as simple as possible compiler and interpretator

- **Who:** designed to be your first tutorial ever about compilers, but not programming in general.
_(if you are looking for something bigger than `Hello World` you may want to check `Reference` section)_

- **Why:** to build big picture
- **Stack:** llvm, haskell

## Intro

Okay, first of all compiler is not a dragon, it's a regular programm, like any another. Programm which translate source code to machine code.


## Let's build it

``` c
/* Hello World program */

#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("It's just for testing fancy syntax highlighting");

}

```
